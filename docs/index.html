        <p><b>Our story:</b> We started as 3 different solo teams working on different projects but destiny had us hacking together in no time as brothers. Being sports enthusiasts as much as space enthusisasts, we chose to use science and tech to have both sides of the pie connected and working together for a better, brighter future in which the sun touches everything in the right way.</p>
